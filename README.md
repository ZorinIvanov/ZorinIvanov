<h1>Hi I'm Zorin!<br/>Data Science, ML & AI Enthusiast; Ex Scientist</h1>

<h2>About</h2>
<p>I am 30 year old Bulgarian. I pursued an Ð°cademic career for half a decade. It was during my last scientific project when I realized that my professional interest was not in the domain field that I researched in but rather in working with data. It is always astonishing to me how much insight one can obtain by applying the appropriate statistical method to a data set.</p><p>In the last 3-4 years I developed curiosity for the tech sector, finance, economy and blockchain technologies. While the predominantly theoretical environment of science is the backbone for tech innovations, in my opinion, the creativity of combining these innovations is what has the most direct impact to solving real-life problems and is what contributes the most to our progress as a human civilization. Because of this I have made the decision to transition from an academic-oriented career path to a more practical one focused on the development of products or services that can directly benefit society. I have been fascinated by the rapid and exponential advancements in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence over the past few years, leading me to strongly believe that this technology is the future; hence I currently dedicate my time and energy in progressing in this field.</p><p>P.S. I love sports. I am a team player (I play football) and a risk-taker (I snowboard). Last but not least I have a creative side too (I play the guitar).
